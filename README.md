# Octave-MatLAB-Blackjack-game-project
My first GUI software project for University course done in Octave GUI tool


This is my first official software project done for one of my University courses. The main idea was to make a simple functional Blackjack game simulation with Hit and Stand buttons. The game includes card images, buttons and logic implementation.

The whole software was made in Octave GUI development kit (free version of MatLAB tool).

To run this program, you must access it through Octave GUI application, download the whole folder and run "blackjack_game.m" program.

Every type of copying this code or distributing it under someone's else name without my previous approval is prohibitet.
